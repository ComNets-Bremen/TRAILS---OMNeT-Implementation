# TRAILS
## Requirements
- Python3

- Copy the content of the Simulator folder from the project with your INET framework.
- Copy the Generator folder in your preferred local directory.

To learn about TRAILS mobility model you can read the file project.pdf or the paper "TRAILS - A Trace-Based Probabilistic Mobility Model" (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3242134)

In order to generate TRAILS graphs and simulate them, read the Implementation chapter of the document project.pdf

The folder analyzeResults contains functions designed to perform statistical tests and performance analysis of results produced by the MobilityModelCheck (https://github.com/ComNets-Bremen/MobilityModelCheck) in combination with the TRAILS simulator in OMNet++.

If you would like a short introduction to the TRAILS model and its implementation you can read the file presentation.pdf.
